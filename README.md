I am a software engineering student with strong technical skills in Java and experience with various JavaScript frameworks. Although I don’t have a single favorite project, I value each one for the opportunity it gives me to improve and grow as a developer. I’ve been using computers since I was six years old, which has fueled my passion for technology. I prefer to keep my social links private.
